# First Challenge

Author: Julian Marc

The project is divided in two sections:

To-do List.

    Here, the user can create, delete and edit tasks.
    Its main parts are the filters (Search name and filter by status), the task list, and a modal, used for adding and editing tasks.

Bonus Calculator

    It provides the user with a calculator, which receives the user's current salary, its years and / or days of employment.
    It outputs the salary per day, per year, current total income and bonus.
    Its parts are the input data form, and the output data results, which have been cojoined through css wizardry.

It also has a simple yet functional Nav and footer bar.
