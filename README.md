# Second Challenge

Author: Julian Marc

The project is divided in three sections.

The first two sections have the same purpose as they did in the first challenge, except that the to-do List has been refactored using classes and improved in its UI and UX

To-do List.

    Here, the user can create, delete and edit tasks.
    Its main parts are the filters (Search name and filter by status), the task list, and a modal, used for adding and editing tasks.

Bonus Calculator

    It provides the user with a calculator, which receives the user's current salary, its years and / or days of employment.
    It outputs the salary per day, per year, current total income and bonus.
    Its parts are the input data form, and the output data results, which have been cojoined through css wizardry.

The last section is the a Github Profile Searcher

    It allows the user to search for a github username, and displays info regarding said username, plus its repositories, if the user has any.

The project also has a simple yet functional Nav and footer bar.
